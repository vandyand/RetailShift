# RetailShift: Interview Project Notes

This document explains how this project demonstrates the skills and experience required in the job description.

## Key Requirements Addressed

### System Architecture and Development

The RetailShift project demonstrates a large-scale system design with high availability (99.99% uptime) through:

- **Microservices Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between services
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Kubernetes HorizontalPodAutoscaler configurations
- **Redundancy**: Multiple replicas of each service
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive readiness and liveness probes
- **Circuit Breakers**: Error handling and graceful degradation

### POS Migration

The legacy-adapter service specifically shows how to:

- Connect to legacy POS systems (via JDBC)
- Transform and normalize data between old and new systems
- Provide backward compatibility during migration
- Stream events for real-time data synchronization
- Handle edge cases like network partitions

### CI/CD Pipelines

The project includes:

- GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration
- Automated testing with Midje
- Code coverage reporting with Cloverage
- Docker image building and pushing
- Automated deployment to Kubernetes
- Environment-specific configurations

### Clojure Development

The codebase showcases:

- Functional programming patterns
- Immutability and pure functions
- Component lifecycle management with Mount
- Concurrency handling
- Rich comment blocks for REPL-driven development
- Comprehensive namespacing

### Microservices & Cloud Architecture

The architecture demonstrates:

- Independent, loosely-coupled services
- Event-driven communication via Kafka
- API contracts and versioning
- Cloud-native configuration
- Infrastructure as Code (Kubernetes manifests)

### Performance Optimization

The project includes:

- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Caching with Redis
- Connection pooling
- Resource limits and requests

### NoSQL Database Usage

MongoDB (representing CosmosDB patterns) is used for:

- Document-based storage
- Flexible schema design
- Scalable data storage
- Aggregation pipelines

## Running the Project

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Start the local environment:
   ```
   make dev-up
   ```
3. Access the services:
   - Legacy Adapter API: http://localhost:8080
   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3000
   - Jaeger: http://localhost:16686

## Discussion Points for Interview

1. **Architecture Decisions**: Why a microservices approach was chosen and how it facilitates POS migration
2. **Scalability**: How the system can scale to handle peak loads (e.g., holiday shopping seasons)
3. **Resilience**: How the system maintains high availability during failures
4. **Data Consistency**: How event sourcing ensures data integrity across services
5. **Security**: Authentication/authorization approach and data protection
6. **Monitoring**: How the system tracks performance and detects issues
7. **DevOps**: CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure automation
8. **Cost Optimization**: Resource management and cloud cost control

## Future Enhancements

If this were a real project, I would extend it with:

1. Service mesh for advanced traffic management (e.g., Istio)
2. Chaos engineering tests to verify resilience
3. Advanced security scanning in the CI pipeline
4. Blue/green deployment strategies
5. Advanced observability with distributed tracing
