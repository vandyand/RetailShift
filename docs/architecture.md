# RetailShift Architecture

## Overview

RetailShift is designed as a cloud-native microservices architecture for migrating legacy POS systems to a modern, scalable platform. The system follows these key architectural principles:

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicate primarily through events, enabling loose coupling and high resilience.
- **Microservices**: Each domain has its own independent service with a bounded context.
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Client applications interact through a centralized gateway.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separate paths for reads and writes to optimize performance.
- **Database-per-Service**: Each service has autonomy over its data storage.

## Components

### Legacy Adapter Service

Acts as a bridge between the legacy POS systems and the modern architecture, with responsibilities including:

- **Data Translation**: Converting legacy database schemas to modern formats
- **Event Publishing**: Generating events for changes detected in legacy systems
- **API Compatibility**: Supporting legacy API endpoints for backward compatibility
- **Incremental Migration**: Facilitating gradual transition without downtime

### Inventory Service

Manages product information and stock levels across the retail system:

- **Product Catalog**: Maintaining product details, pricing, and taxonomy
- **Stock Management**: Tracking inventory levels across multiple locations
- **Reorder Processing**: Managing restock workflows and vendor integrations
- **Inventory Events**: Publishing inventory-related events (stock changes, price updates)

### Transaction Service

Handles all aspects of sales transactions:

- **Transaction Processing**: Capturing and validating sale transactions
- **Payment Integration**: Interfacing with payment processors
- **Receipt Generation**: Creating digital receipts
- **Transaction Analytics**: Collecting metadata for business intelligence

### Customer Service

Manages customer relationships and data:

- **Profile Management**: Storing and updating customer information
- **Loyalty Programs**: Tracking points, rewards, and customer tiers
- **Preference Storage**: Maintaining customer preferences and history
- **GDPR Compliance**: Handling data privacy requirements

### Analytics Service

Processes business intelligence needs:

- **Data Aggregation**: Combining data from multiple services
- **Report Generation**: Creating standard and custom reports
- **Dashboard Data**: Providing real-time metrics
- **Historical Analysis**: Enabling trend analysis over time

### Gateway Service

Provides a unified API interface for clients:

- **Request Routing**: Directing client requests to appropriate services
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Enforcing security policies
- **Rate Limiting**: Protecting services from excessive traffic
- **Response Aggregation**: Combining responses from multiple services

## Infrastructure Components

### Kafka

Serves as the backbone for event-driven communication:

- **Event Streaming**: Reliable delivery of events between services
- **Event Sourcing**: Maintaining a log of all changes
- **Stream Processing**: Enabling real-time data processing

### MongoDB

NoSQL database for flexible data storage:

- **Document Storage**: Schema-flexible storage for service data
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling for growing data volumes
- **Aggregation Pipeline**: Advanced query capabilities

### Kubernetes

Orchestrates containerized services:

- **Service Deployment**: Managing container lifecycle
- **Auto-scaling**: Adjusting resources based on demand
- **Self-healing**: Recovering from failures automatically
- **Rolling Updates**: Enabling zero-downtime deployments

### Monitoring Stack

Comprehensive observability solution:

- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Data visualization and dashboards
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing for performance analysis
- **ELK Stack**: Centralized logging

## Data Flow

1. **Legacy POS Event Flow**:

   - Legacy systems write to their databases
   - Legacy Adapter detects changes via polling or triggers
   - Events are published to Kafka topics
   - Modern services consume these events and update their state

2. **New Transaction Flow**:

   - Gateway receives transaction request
   - Transaction service processes the sale
   - Events published for inventory updates, customer loyalty, etc.
   - Appropriate services consume events and update state
   - Analytics service captures data for reporting

3. **Query Flow**:
   - Clients request data via Gateway
   - Gateway routes to appropriate service(s)
   - Services return data from their databases
   - Gateway aggregates and formats response

## High Availability and Scaling

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Services scale independently based on demand
- **Geographic Redundancy**: Deployments across multiple regions
- **Circuit Breaking**: Preventing cascading failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintaining core functionality during partial outages
- **Caching Layers**: Redis caching for frequently accessed data

## Security Architecture

- **API Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Encryption**: TLS for all connections
- **Secret Management**: Secure storage for credentials
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
